#Introduction to Docker Compose
###what is Docker Compose ?
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application’s services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

###How to use docker compose 
Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.
